Randall Cunningham was impressed with your initial analysis and reporting of the data. You have been promoted to work with the data science team. At this moment, he needs your help in identifying certain customers contained within a data file. You have been given access to the data file CaliforniaHospitalData_Personnel.txt, which contains sensitive information on some employees. You also have access to CaliforniaHospitalData.csv. You will need to merge these two files together to perform the tasks below.

Create regular expressions to identify certain employees contained within the dataset. 

Obtain a list of all employees who are regional representatives; use the title itself, not the ID number. Print the list to the console.

Obtain all personnel who work for a hospital that meets the following critera: 

non-profit or investor

the five-digit zip zode ends with 2, 4, 5, or 6

when done, output the columns Zip, TypeControl, LastName, FirstName, PositionTitle

Print to the console.

Same as #3, except exclude all individuals who are safety inspection members. Print the list of people to the console.
